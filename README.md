## InSzn  
inseason.in is a platform to display what fruits and vegetables are inseason.
It is a simple product built using scalable architecture ontop of dockerized AWS EC2 instances and cloud database storage.

This repository is for the front end portion which is built in react. With the frontend portion I explored professional UI design to attempt to create a calming user experience. 

To see the backend, check out my InSzn-web repository.
